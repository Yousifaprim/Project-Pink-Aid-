## Why Project-Pink-Aid? 

In my community, I saw that homeless veterans were struggling without adequate support. Motivated to make a difference, my team and I developed a chatbox designed to provide real-life help. This tool allows veterans to easily find essential services such as guidance and support, job training programs and language translation assistance.

Our mission is straight forward: Help Lives, One Vet at a Time. By leveraging this chatbox, we aim to make a big impact, offering the vital support veterans need to succeed.
