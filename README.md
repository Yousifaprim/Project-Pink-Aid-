## Overview

Chatbot that assists Homeless Veterans 24/7 in exploring guidance, so they can help with life struggles they have. 

## CASExplorer: What is it?

**Project-Pink-Aid** (*Pronounced as “case explorer”*):

The **“Project-Pink-Aid”** part of our virtual assistant name stands for the various sections provided in our virtual assistants for Homeless Vets to explore: **C**areer, **G**dance, and **S**elf exploration. The terms CASE and Explorer from how an individual, a case, will explore the different aspects within our chatbot. There could be many different ways Homeless Vets can navigate the virtual assistant for their own needs, hence the name CASExplorer.


## Why CASExplorer? 

Educational institutions are one of the most affected areas that are transitioning to virtual learning to limit the spread of the COVID-19. The pandemic exacerbates many students’ anxiety about their academic careers and futures. Career advisors can provide one-on-one support for students to achieve their goals, however, there are not enough advisors for the thousands of students at a university. The move to online services is no different; virtual appointments with career counselors are still scarce due to high demand. In addition, career counselors are focused on providing general career advice to students rather than specific advice because their audience are students coming from a variety of majors. 

Existing chatbot solutions for education do some form of the following:
- Answers general questions about a specific university e.g. “When will I receive financial aid?”
- Quizzes students on specific subject e.g. science

Therefore, our prototype aims to take a different approach to: 
- Provide career assistance in STEM 24/7
- Assist students who are unsure about the STEM major to study
- Assist students who are curious about switching to a STEM major
- Filter out information from Google giving relevant results on STEM 
- Be a universal chatbot for all college students, where information is not centered on a single school

Most importantly, our prototype aims to provide virtual guidance and support to students, so they can be more confident with their major and career choices. In the future, we hope to expand the chatbot to other fields of study.
