## Project-Pink-Aid: What is it?
The "Project-Pink-Aid" part of our chatbot's name replies to the several sectors in which Homeless Vets are equipped with the following: Self-exploration, Guidance, and Career. That's why we designed you to take full advantage of our chatbot tool as an individual. The name Project-Pink-Aid is derived from how homeless veterans can utilize the virtual assistant in various ways as per their individual needs.

## Why Project-Pink-Aid? 

I saw the homeless veterans in my city were really struggling and this moved me to show them some love. I put together a chat box that would always offer real time help. Veterans can communicate with it by asking about places where they can get vocation training and even get translations made into different languages.

Another part of the chatbox also helps them to make their resume better such that then they can quickly find jobs.

Our main goal is to Improve Lives, One Vet at a Time.
