Chatbot that assists Homeless Veterans 24/7 in exploring guidance, so they can help with life struggles they have. 

## Project-Pink-Aid: What is it?

**Project-Pink-Aid** (*Pronounced as “Project-Pink-Aid”*):

The **“Project-Pink-Aid”** portion of our virtual assistant's name refers to the several areas that are available for Homeless Vets to peruse: **S** Self-exploration, **G** dancing, and **C**areer. We are here to help you discover the many features of our chatbot as an individual. The moniker Project-Pink-Aid comes from the many ways that homeless veterans might use the virtual assistant to suit their individual requirements.


## Why Project-Pink-Aid? 

I noticed that homeless veterans in my community weren't getting much help, so I decided to do something about it. I created a chatbox that offers real help. Veterans can ask it questions like where to find job training and can even get help translating things into different languages.

Our chatbox also helps veterans improve their resumes, making it easier for them to find jobs.

Our goal is simple: Help Lives, One Vet at a Time. We're using this chatbox to make a big difference for veterans, giving them the support they need to succeed.
